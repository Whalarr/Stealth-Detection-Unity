# Stealth-Detection-Unity

A small side project that will act as a repository for mechanics that are commonly featured in 3D stealth games. 
This project will be built on and updated with more mechanics in the future and past mechanics will be revised and improved.

The current project features checkpoint based patrol routes and vision based detection, agents have awareness of nearby events 
and will respond to the player moving either within their area of vision or by being within a close proximity to the player.

Future planned additions for this project will be a more dynamic system allowing agents to respond to audio, plan and change 
their routes at runtime and incoporate crowd simulations to make the scene more densely populated.
